            What does Pure Bank of Texas do with your personal information?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Why?</strong><br />
            Financial companies choose how they share your personal information.
            Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all
            sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect,
            share, and protect your personal information. Please read this
            notice carefully to understand what we do.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What?</strong><br />
            The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the
            product or service you have with us. This information can include:

            When you are no longer our customer, we continue to share your
            information as described in this notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How?</strong><br />
            All financial companies need to share customers’ personal
            information to run their everyday business. In the section below, we
            list the reasons financial companies can share their customers’
            personal information; the reasons Pure Bank of Texas chooses to

            buildings. We also maintain other physical, electronic and
            procedural safeguards to protect this information and we limit

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why can’t I limit all sharing?</strong><br />
